   3. Assignment 6 - Photon Mapper

   4. Manipulated kdtree to accept photons instead of points, then added a flux elimante to ray trace
      to take advantage of kdtree k nearest neighbors to figure out the actual flux of the image 

   5. I learned more about C++ syntax and how to derive classes, as well as syntax needed to render flux
      in a photon mapper after finding the nearest neighbors to each photon

   6. make
      ./main airball.txt > img.ppm
      xv img.ppm
